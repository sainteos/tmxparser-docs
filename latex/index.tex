This is a library for parsing the maps generated by \href{https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/}{\tt Tiled Map Editor}.

The T\-M\-X format is based upon X\-M\-L and may contain compressed and encoded tile data to save memory and reduce file sizes. This parser uses the \href{http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/}{\tt Tiny\-X\-M\-L} library and its D\-O\-M interface to parse T\-M\-X files.

An example file is provided to understand how to use the library.

This project is forked from \href{https://code.google.com/p/tmx-parser/}{\tt https\-://code.\-google.\-com/p/tmx-\/parser/} because\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Organized cleanly for inclusion into Debian. This means depending on zlib and Tiny\-X\-M\-L externally, building a shared library, installing to the correct prefix, etc.
\item Drop support for Android and Windows. If you want a Windows build, use \href{https://github.com/mxe/mxe}{\tt mxe}.
\item Resolving the open issues\-: \href{https://code.google.com/p/tmx-parser/issues/list}{\tt https\-://code.\-google.\-com/p/tmx-\/parser/issues/list}
\item More robust tests.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Conformity with the \href{http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/reference/tmx-map-format/}{\tt T\-M\-X specification page}.
\item Decodes and decompresses tile data.
\item Can parse properties as both integers, real numbers and literals (strings).
\item Can parse the map file when stored in memory.
\item Does not rely on any graphics library.
\item Animated tile support.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item zlib
\item Tiny\-X\-M\-L
